The web application will be supported by a live data feed provided by the National Weather Service (NWS). This project aims to allow users to use the web application to check for any weather warnings, watches, or advisory statements in their area or elsewhere in the USA. The front end (i.e., user interface) will allow users to search, locate, and request information provided by the NWS through the web application. Users can choose to mark themselves safe during a weather event and have it displayed on the web application.
